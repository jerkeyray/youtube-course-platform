# Yudoku

Yudoku is a focused way to learn from YouTube — without getting trapped in the algorithm.

It turns playlists into structured courses so you can actually finish what you start.

No feeds.  
No recommendations.  
No endless scrolling.

Just progress.

## Why Yudoku Exists

Most learning platforms optimize for attention, not completion.

You open a video to learn one thing and end up watching ten more you never planned to. Yudoku exists to break that loop.

It’s built around a simple idea:

**Learning should have an end.**

## What Yudoku Does

### Turns playlists into courses  
Any YouTube playlist becomes a structured course with clear progress.

### Tracks real progress  
You always know what you’ve finished and what’s left. No fake productivity.

### Saves moments, not noise  
Save timestamps to return to important moments later.  
Not notes. Not essays. Just context you can jump back to.

### Removes distractions  
No recommendations.  
No algorithmic feed.  
No infinite scroll.

## What Yudoku Is Not

- Not a note-taking app  
- Not a second brain  
- Not another content platform  

It’s a focused layer on top of YouTube that helps you *finish* what you start.

## About

Yudoku was built out of frustration with half-finished courses and the illusion of productivity.

If it helps you finish something you would’ve otherwise abandoned, it’s doing its job.
